# ðŸš€ ADOS Deployment Guide

## Step 1: Set Up Hosted Supabase Database

### Run Database Migrations

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/cyodlgfmrsvpocvgbykn
2. Click on **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
3. Click **New Query**
4. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql`
5. Click **Run** to execute the migration
6. You should see "Success. No rows returned"

### Seed Initial Data

1. Still in the SQL Editor, create another **New Query**
2. Copy and paste the entire contents of `supabase/seed.sql`
3. Click **Run** to execute
4. This will create the ADOS 2025 event and questions

### Set Up Discord OAuth (Important!)

1. Go to **Authentication** â†’ **Providers** in your Supabase dashboard
2. Enable **Discord** provider
3. You'll need to create a Discord OAuth app:
   - Go to https://discord.com/developers/applications
   - Click "New Application"
   - Go to **OAuth2** â†’ **General**
   - Add redirect URL: `https://cyodlgfmrsvpocvgbykn.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`
   - Copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
4. Paste them into your Supabase Discord provider settings
5. Save the settings

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Prepare Repository

1. Initialize git (if not already):
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

2. Push to GitHub:
```bash
# Create a new repo on GitHub, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ados.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Deploy on Railway

1. Go to https://railway.app/new
2. Click **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. Select your `ados` repository
4. Railway will auto-detect Next.js

### Configure Environment Variables

In Railway dashboard, add these environment variables:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://cyodlgfmrsvpocvgbykn.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6ImN5b2RsZ2ZtcnN2cG9jdmdieWtuIiwicm9sZSI6ImFub24iLCJpYXQiOjE3NTk1OTU2NTAsImV4cCI6MjA3NTE3MTY1MH0.mKz6aOOS6mckQFLrQs8f65FzBAq6zwOyX-3bg3jfIDw
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-app.railway.app
```

**Important:** Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` with your actual Railway URL after deployment!

### Update Discord OAuth Redirect

After you get your Railway URL:
1. Go back to Discord Developer Portal
2. Add another redirect URL: `https://your-app.railway.app/auth/callback`
3. Update Supabase Discord provider with the same redirect URL

## Step 3: Add Video Files

Your videos need to be accessible:

**Option 1: Keep in repo (Simple)**
- Videos are in `/public/bg.mp4` and `/public/bg_epic.mov`
- These will deploy with your app
- Note: May make deployments slower

**Option 2: Use CDN (Better for production)**
- Upload videos to a CDN (Cloudflare R2, AWS S3, etc.)
- Update paths in `components/Hero.tsx` to point to CDN URLs

## Step 4: Test Everything

1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Test the landing page (both Chill and Epic modes)
3. Click "I'd like to join" â†’ should redirect to event page
4. Click "Proceed to questions" â†’ should show auth modal
5. Try signing in with Discord
6. Complete the questionnaire
7. Try the invite code feature with code: `goodiewoodie`

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Live!

Your ADOS application is now deployed and ready for applicants!

## Troubleshooting

**Videos not loading?**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify video files are in the correct format (H.264 MP4 recommended)
- Check file sizes - Railway has deployment limits

**Auth not working?**
- Verify Discord OAuth redirect URLs match exactly
- Check environment variables are set correctly in Railway
- Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` matches your Railway domain

**Database errors?**
- Verify migrations ran successfully in Supabase SQL Editor
- Check RLS policies are enabled
- Verify seed data was inserted
